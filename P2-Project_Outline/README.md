# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview

I want to build a web app that helps users search for towing services 
in their area. This app would be used mainly by companies that offer 
roadside assistance to their customers. This app would allow reps to 
search for towing companies based on certain criteria and allow their customers to 
search and contact roadside services as well.

This idea comes from my experience working as a customer service representative
at a company that offers roadside assistance. At present, there is 
a need to simplify the process of helping customers get that assistance.

### Features
- Optional login or use as guest capability.
- Search by zipcode, name, type of service needed.
- Allow customers to enter pick-up and destination info
- Compare button to compare prices and services offered
- Chat feature to ask questions.
- Contact feature to call (mobile).

### Technologies

- PHP
- MySQL
- Atom 


### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to build a database from scratch, as well as authentication for 
login. I plan to make this app mobile-friendly, so I will probably look into Kik framework.
